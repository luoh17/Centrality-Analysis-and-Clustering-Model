• Built a partitioned local depth framework to model neural network with patients’ brain node data to narrow down the contributing
factors to Alzheimer’s disease
• Devloped K-means clustering and adopted centrality measure in graph theory with iterations to identify the most influencing
regions to facilitate the clinical study
• Generated Image plots, heatmaps, PaLD graph and scatterplot to verify hypothesis on cross ties relationships in brain
